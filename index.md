## Project Purpose and Justification

The Asset Record Review System aims to enhance asset lifecycle management by integrating multiple data sources, including SCCM, Active Directory (AD), Mobile Device Management (MDM), Intune, SolarWinds, and warranty data from HP, Dell, and Lenovo. The system will compare asset records with ServiceNow to determine whether equipment should continue to be used or replaced. This will improve accuracy, optimize IT spending, and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

### Project Objectives

* Automate Asset Record Validation: Ensure asset data from SCCM, AD, MDM, Intune, and SolarWinds is accurate and up-to-date in ServiceNow.
* Integrate Warranty Information: Utilize API interfaces from HP, Dell, and Lenovo to track warranty status and lifecycle data.
* Assess Equipment Status: Compare collected data with ServiceNow records to determine continued use or replacement.
* Enhance Reporting and Decision-Making: Provide insights into asset lifecycle status for proactive IT asset management.

### Scope Statement

#### In Scope:

* Integration of SCCM, AD, MDM, Intune, and SolarWinds with ServiceNow.
* API-based integration with HP, Dell, Lenovo and Cisco warranty data.
* Implementation of automated comparison logic to identify discrepancies and make asset lifecycle recommendations.
* Development of reporting dashboards in ServiceNow for real-time insights.
* Role-based access control for asset management and review functionalities.
* Testing and validation of data accuracy before deployment.

#### Out of Scope:

* Procurement of hardware or new software beyond the required integrations.
* Direct management of vendor APIs beyond available functionalities.
* End-user device management outside asset record validation.
